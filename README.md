# Notebuds
As a student of any discipline, you are bound to take a lot of notes on a variety of topics in order to master the subject quickly. But how and where will you store them? Most students take notes in their notebooks or on sheets of paper or save them in some kind of cloud (Google Docs, Notion, etc.). But over time, students often start to face a problem where they cannot find a specific note. We believe that by providing a web app that can keep everything in one place and easily find any notes students have taken before, we will help students to save a lot of time, keep track of what they have learned, and by making it interactive with other students it can encourage learning
